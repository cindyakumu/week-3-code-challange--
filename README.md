# Concert Management System

This project helps manage bands, venues, and concerts in a simple and organized way. In this README, you'll find explanations on how the project works, how to set it up, and how to use it.

## Project Overview

This project allows you to:
- Add bands and venues to a database.
- Record concerts where bands perform at different venues.
- Find out which band has played the most concerts at a specific venue.

The main components of the system are:
- **Band**: Represents a music group, including details like the band’s name and hometown.
- **Venue**: Represents a location where concerts take place, including details like the venue’s title and city.
- **Concert**: Represents an event where a band plays at a venue, including details like the concert date.

## Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:
- **Python**: The programming language used for building the application.
- **PostgreSQL**: The database system used to store information about bands, venues, and concerts.
- **psycopg2**: A Python library that connects and interacts with the PostgreSQL database.

## Setup Instructions

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Install PostgreSQL**: Make sure you have PostgreSQL installed on your computer. You can download it from the official PostgreSQL website.

2. **Create a Database**: Set up a new database for the project.

3. **Install psycopg2**: Use pip to install the psycopg2 library, which allows Python to interact with PostgreSQL.

4. **Set Up Tables**: Create the necessary tables for bands, venues, and concerts in your database.

5. **Run the Program**: Open your Python environment and execute the main program file. Make sure to adjust the database connection settings if needed.

## How to Use

Once the program is running, you can:
- Add a band and a venue to the database.
- Record a concert by specifying the band, venue, and date.
- Check which band has played the most concerts at a venue.

## Code Structure

Here's a brief overview of the main files:
- **band.py**: Contains the `Band` class to manage band details and record concerts.
- **concert.py**: Contains the `Concert` class to represent concert events and their details.
- **venue.py**: Contains the `Venue` class to manage venue information and find the most frequent band.
